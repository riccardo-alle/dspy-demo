    "- I strongly recommend reading the [DSPy Cheatsheet](https://dspy.ai/cheatsheet/) it will help you with quick start;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do you want know more about DSPY optimizers? Read [this guide](https://dspy.ai/learn/optimization/optimizers/?h=optimizers)!\n",
    "\n",
    "- You find tons of tutorials in [dpsy/examples](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/blob/main/examples) folder;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remember the DSPy \"scientific method\":\n",
    "  - **Define your task**: what is the input? What is the expected output?\n",
    "  - **Define your pipeline**: do we need ChainOfThoughts? Do we need any external tool, like a retriever?\n",
    "  - **Explore a few examples**: explore both input and output. It might be worth to annotate few examples for debugging purposes.\n",
    "  - **Define your data**: define training and validation sets;\n",
    "  - **Define your metric**: define an objective metric you will use to evaluate your programs. You don't have it? You can ask an LLM to evaluate for you!\n",
    "  - **Collect preliminary \"zero-shot\" evaluations**: try out your program without optimization to get baseline results;\n",
    "  - **Compile with a DSPy optimizer**: start with FewShot optimizers and follow with more complex ones, like MIPRO, COPROv2...\n",
    "  - **Iterate**: iterate the steps above, until you are satisfief with the results! "

    "## Setting up Signatures and Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core DSPy Components\n",
    "\n",
    "[dspy.Signature](https://dspy.ai/learn/programming/signatures/) and [dspy.Module](https://dspy.ai/learn/programming/modules/) are fundamental building blocks for DSPy programs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Signature**: A declarative specification of the input/output behavior of a DSPy module.\n",
    "- **Module**: A building block for programs that leverage Language Models (LMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of DSPy Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy offers various module types, each serving different purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [dspy.Predict](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/api/modules/Predict)\n",
    "   - Basic predictor\n",
    "   - Maintains the original signature\n",
    "   - Handles key forms of learning (storing instructions, demonstrations, and LM updates)\n",
    "   - Most similar to direct LM usage\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [dspy.ChainOfThought](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/api/modules/ChainOfThought)\n",
    "   - Enhances the LM to think step-by-step before producing the final response\n",
    "   - Modifies the signature to incorporate intermediate reasoning steps\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "3. [Additional Advanced Modules](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/api/category/modules)\n",
    "   - DSPy library offers a range of more specialized modules for complex tasks;\n",
    "   - In this talk, we will explore the [ReAct](https://dspy.ai/deep-dive/modules/react/) module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation for starting\n",
    "\n",
    "For those new to DSPy, it's advisable to start with `dspy.Predict`. Its simplicity makes it ideal for understanding the basics of DSPy operation. Once you've successfully implemented your program using `dspy.Predict`, you can explore more advanced modules like `dspy.ChainOfThought` to potentially enhance your model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an overview of other prompting techniques beyond zero-shot learning, refer to the [Prompting Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques). This resource covers various methods that can enhance your DSPy applications as you progress."
